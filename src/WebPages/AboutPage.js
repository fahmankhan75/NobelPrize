        The prize
The Nobel Prize is awarded to ‘those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind’. Prizes in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace have been awarded since 1901 – and economic sciences since 1968.

The party
On 10 December – Nobel Day – award ceremonies take place in both Stockholm, Sweden, and Oslo, Norway. At the Stockholm Concert Hall, the winners in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and economic sciences receive a medal from the King of Sweden, as well as a diploma and a cash award. The ceremony is followed by a gala banquet at Stockholm City Hall.

The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded in Oslo City Hall on the same day.

The man
The Nobel Prize is the legacy of Sweden’s Alfred Nobel (1833–1896). A chemist, engineer, inventor and entrepreneur, Nobel was devoted to the study of explosives, and his inventions include a blasting cap, dynamite and smokeless gunpowder.

When Nobel died, he held 355 patents in different countries and had made a fortune. His last will, signed in 1895, is the reason that the Nobel Prize is awarded every year. He had an idea about an annual prize that would go to brilliant minds around the world.
